# Environment

## Initial setup
**Do not need to repeat this.**
Recording how I initially setup the environment
```bash
# Initial environment setup
source /anaconda3/bin/activate
conda create -n python-ml-workshop --clone root
```
Note, that to create a working anaconda environment, I had to do it from the command line. Using anaconda-navigator did not create working environments for me for some reason.

## Environment activation
**Do this in every new terminal.**

Activate the correct anaconda environment
```bash
# Activate Anaconda
source /anaconda3/bin/activate
# Switch to workshop-specific environment
conda activate python-ml-workshop
```
